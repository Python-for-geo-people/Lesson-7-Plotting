# Exercise 7 hints

## Problem 1

## Problem 2
### Pseudocode
There is no pseudocode to post since the exercise included a starter code.
There are, however, some important practical tips below.

### Practial tips
- **Using plotly-friendly plot colors**.
One of the bad surprises this week with plotly was that you cannot save your plots if they contain any "pro" colors, like solid red, black or blue.
One option that is easy to implement is to simply give the commands in matplotlib that produce different parts of the plot the `color` parameter.
For instance, when you plot a set of red points using `plt.plot()`, you could change the formatting parameter from `'ro'` to simply `'o'`, and add a parameter to the list for `color="#D62728"`, the "free" red on the plotly site.
To be perfectly clear, this would look like

    ```python
    plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color="#D62728")   # This is OK for plotly
    ```
rather than

    ```python
    plt.plot(x, y, 'ro')   # This uses the non-free "pro" red on plotly
    ```
In fact, you could even go one step further and create a list of colors at the top of your script, and use those with the `color` option.
For example,

    ```python
    # Define some plotly-friendly colors
    red="#D62728"
    blue="#1F77B4"
    dkgray="#444444"
    
    # Make some plot
    plt.plot(x, y, 'o', color=red)
    plt.title('My amazing plot', color=dkgray)
    ```
et voil√†, your plot should now use plotly-friendly colors, which means you can modify things *and save* without problems.
- **Getting plots with a legend to export to plotly**.
Yet another unpleasant surprise.
As far as I can tell, it is currently not possible to use matplotlib to create a line and symbol legend on a plot, and have the exported to plotly.
If you've tried this, you have undoubtedly encountered problems.
Fortunately, we have a solution, albeit not a solution that is simply fixing a single line.
To start, we can compare the codes below for making a plot and exporting to plotly.
The top one will not work, the lower has been fixed to export to plotly.
The `...` lines are places where many other lines of code exist, but are not relevant for this issue.

    ```python
    # THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH PLOTLY
    
    # Import libraries
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import plotly.plotly as py
    from scipy.stats import linregress
    
    ...
    
    # Add legend
    plt.legend()
    
    # Export figure to plotly
    unique_url = py.plot_mpl(mpl_fig, filename="Seasonal average temperatures")

    ...
    ```
    
    ```python
    # THIS WILL WORK WITH PLOTLY
    
    # Import libraries
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import plotly.plotly as py
    import plotly.tools as tls   # THIS IMPORT HAS BEEN ADDED
    from scipy.stats import linregress

    ...

    # DO NOT USE plt.legend(), DO THIS INSTEAD
    plotly_fig = tls.mpl_to_plotly(mpl_fig)   # This makes a plotly figure from matplotlib

    # Add plotly legend
    plotly_fig['layout']['showlegend'] = True
    plotly_fig['layout']['legend'] = {}
    
    # Export to plotly
    plot_url = py.plot(plotly_fig, filename='Seasonal average temperatures')
    
    ...
    ```
As you can see, this is not a one-line fix, but it is also not that complicated.
In essence, we need to `import plotly.tools as tls`, and replace the use of `plt.legend()` and `py.ploy(...)` with the corresponding commands to have plotly create the legend.
In this way, your plots should go nicely to plotly, including the legend.
If you combine this fix with the plotly colors tip above, you should be in business!
- **Example data files**
In case you don't yet have Exercises 5 or 6 working properly, we would still like you to be able to complete Exercise 7.
For that task we have provided example data files produced by Exercises 5 and 6.
For these data files, the data starts at 1940 and ends at 2015, which simply allows us to see whether you've used your own data file you produced, or the example data files.
Otherwise, they should be identical to the expected results from Exercises 5 and 6.
Links to the files are below.

  - [Summer temperatures from Exercise 6](../Data/summer-avg-temps-ex6.csv)
  - [Winter temperatures from Exercise 5](../Data/winter-avg-temps-ex5.csv)
  - [Winter temperatures from Exercise 6](../Data/winter-avg-temps-ex6.csv)
- **Using `linregress()`**
- **Modifying the axis ranges**
